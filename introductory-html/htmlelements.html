      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello there! (<em>My name is</em>) Mehedi, I'm 21 and I usually reside in the West in the Republic of Ireland. I'm currently a student at <strong>Ulster Uni in Belfast</strong>.<br /><br /> And I usually am very curious and curious minded, and I'd usually love devling myself into the world of engineering</p>
      <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Being curious in engineering and how thw world works</li>
        <li>Somewhat into gaming, my favourites - Star Wars Battlefront II, War Thunder, Battlefield I + V, Minecraft, Fortnite and action series.</li>
        <li>I love history, espcially leader and empire based history, my most favourite being Islamic history</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>How I define the world today</h3>
      <p>I would say the world right now, is more than a test, and I believe my creator (Allah swt) is testing me on how to become better and firm with the laws and guidance he has given us, hence why I'm trying to be better every single day.</p>

Whether being a Full-Stack Engineer, or an Inventor, or an Orator, it's all in Allah, the Almighty's hands, and I hope when Allah gives me the opportunity, to go back to Makkah and Madinah, as I feel I need that visit for my heart, as I hope in the years to come, he gives me someone who cares as unfortunately apart from Allah swt, no one really cared about me and I felt truly alone for the past 21 years now, hence why my fixation on isolation and vunerablity while mainting my character and standard.</p>
